# Historical Rankings of Top 10 Programming Languages in 2023

In this Jupyter Notebook, we explore the historical rankings of the top 10 programming languages in 2023 as per the TIOBE Index. The TIOBE Index is a widely recognized ranking of programming languages based on their popularity and usage.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the TIOBE Index and includes long-term historical rankings of various programming languages. We focus specifically on the year 2023 and the top 10 languages based on their rankings. You can find the dataset in the following file:

- [tiobe_index_very_long_term_history.csv](data/tiobe_index_very_long_term_history.csv)

## Visualization

To gain insights into the changes in programming language popularity over time, we have created a visualization that displays the historical rankings of these top 10 languages from 1998 to 2023. Each line represents a programming language, and its color reflects its rank in 2023.

## Analysis and Insights

As we examine the visualization, we can make observations about the rise and fall of programming languages over the years, with a particular emphasis on the top 10 languages in 2023. The highlighted colors represent the top 3 languages in 2023, providing a clear visual distinction.

Please follow along as we analyze the historical rankings and trends of these programming languages.

# Insights

In our analysis of historical programming language rankings spanning from 1988 to 2023, several key observations have emerged.

### Stability at the Top
- The programming languages C and Java have demonstrated remarkable stability by consistently securing top positions in the rankings over the decades. Particularly noteworthy is the enduring dominance of C since 1988, underscoring its importance in systems programming. Despite briefly dropping to the second position in 2018, Java swiftly reclaimed the top spot in 2023, illustrating its resilience and continued relevance.

### Python's Remarkable Rise
- Python has experienced a remarkable ascent in popularity, especially within the last decade. Beginning from a relatively modest ranking in 1998, Python steadily climbed to the number one position in 2023. This remarkable growth can be attributed to its versatility, simplicity, and widespread adoption across various domains, including web development, data science, and machine learning.

### C++ and C# Dynamics
- C++ has maintained a consistently strong presence, frequently ranking in the top five languages. This stability reflects its enduring popularity for performance-critical applications. In contrast, C# has experienced some fluctuations in rankings but has generally remained within the top ten. Its usage in game development and Windows applications has contributed to its sustained relevance.

### Highlighting Dominance Periods
- It is essential to acknowledge periods of dominance for specific languages. For instance, C and C++ dominated the early years of the dataset, while Python's dominance began in the 2020s. The dominance of a language often correlates with significant technological shifts or community-driven initiatives.

### Influence of Global Events
While the dataset does not provide detailed information about external events, it is reasonable to assume that global technological trends, such as the rise of the internet, mobile computing, and data science, have exerted a substantial influence on language rankings.

In conclusion, this analysis offers an overview of the trends and dynamics observed in the dataset. A comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind these trends would require additional context and consideration of external factors. Please feel free to explore the visualizations and data further to gain deeper insights into the historical rankings of programming languages.

**Insights:**

1. **C's Dominance**: Throughout the observed period, the C programming language has consistently maintained the top position, indicating its enduring relevance and widespread use in the industry.
2. **Java's Decline**: Java, once a dominant language in earlier years, has seen a noticeable decline, particularly in the latter years, showing a shift in preference among developers and organizations.
3. **Python's Rise**: Python has shown a significant upward trajectory, especially in recent years. This can be attributed to its versatility, including its use in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.
4. **New Entrants**: Languages like SQL and PHP, which were not initially among the top contenders, have made their way up the ranks, indicating their growing importance in specific domains.
5. **Consistent Contenders**: Languages like Assembly, though not the most popular, have remained consistent in their rankings, indicating niche yet steady applications.

**Conclusion:**

The landscape of programming languages is ever-evolving, with some languages rising in popularity due to emerging trends, while others maintain their position due to their foundational importance. As technologies advance, developers and organizations must remain adaptable, choosing the right tools for their specific needs. The TIOBE Index provides a valuable snapshot of these trends, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
